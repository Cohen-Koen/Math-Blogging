# Math Blogs
Here I will post certain blogs, scans, detailing my progress and experience as mathematician.


>Background:
>
>At the time of creating this (NOT necessarily the current moment), 11/11/2025, I am a high school student taking courses in vector and numerical analysis, auditing graduate real analysis (measure theory). It is my senior year and I have made my college applications.
>
>I have done a small quantity of work in a study in order theory headed by my advisor and mentor who runs our M.S. in pure mathematics program.
>
>My main interests are in analysis and order theory (a foundational area).

This blog is NOT supposed to be pretty, it is supposed to detail every step of the way: the wrong theorems, the conjectures, and ultimately my growth as a mathematician. Sometimes my logs will be typewritten sometimes they will be typeset in LaTeX. Just bear with me.

Table Of Contents:

* [1.](MyMath/AEOTA.pdf) Exploring how I can try to tie order theory and analysis together.

Currently:
Synthesizing a satisfactory path topology.
